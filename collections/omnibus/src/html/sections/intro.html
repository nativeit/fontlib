        Google Fonts is always looking for ways to make the web faster and more expressive, but with the Omnibus-Type Press Series, we've added an offline twist. This new collection is specifically intended for text-intensive formats like books, magazines, and newspapers—whether onscreen or in print. Each font was inspired by a traditional print typeface and designed with generous proportions for immersive reading across platforms.

        The Omnibus-Type collective was founded upon a shared typographic passion. Our work is conceived at the intersection of different ideas, cultures, and even continents. At Omnibus, typefaces are born and given room to grow and develop as living beings with pulsing thoughts, knowledge, and emotions. 
      </p>
      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        Whether these fonts are displayed on screen or paper, created by old-school artists or digital natives, Omnibus combines insights from academic research with common sense from strolling the streets. Some projects are born free, to be used and seen by millions all over the world, while others begin with a client in search of an exclusive brand font or unique letterform identity.
      </p>
      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        All of our works are maturing and evolving continuously. Omnibus-Type combines a keen aesthetic sense with technical precision, continually adapting our work for new uses, new languages, and new technologies.
